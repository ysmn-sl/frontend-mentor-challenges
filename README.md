## About

This repository is a collection of different front-end coding challenges that I completed from Frontend Mentor. The challenges range in complexity and focus on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various front-end libraries like React and Tailwind CSS.

The aim of these challenges is to:

- Improve my coding and problem-solving skills.
- Practice responsive design and cross-browser compatibility.
- Experiment with modern front-end technologies.
- Get hands-on experience with real-world UI components.

## Challenges

Each challenge has its own directory in the `src/challenges/` folder, containing:

- HTML/JSX structure.
- CSS/Tailwind for styling.
- JavaScript/React for interactivity and dynamic content.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Main framework for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for fast styling.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For logic and interactivity.
- **HTML5/CSS3**: Base technologies for structuring and styling.
- **GitHub**: Version control and project hosting.
- **Frontend Mentor**: The platform providing the challenges.
